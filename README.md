# Low_C-SNR_Bubble_Detection
A Wolfram Mathematica image processing code for bubble flow images with low SNR/CNR.  
Originally developed for high-FPS neutron imaging through thick (~ 30 mm) liquid metal layers.  

The utilized methods and implementation are outlined in a recent publication:  
http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app11209710  
where both performance analysis and direct experimental validation are provided.

ATTENTION: the post-processing part of the code uses a package

The image processing code is in the MAIN notebook; the two other notebooks are the code used for validation based on reference experiments.


Q: How does one use the code?  
A: Instructions soon to be posted here.  


Q: Is there an example dataset to test the code?  
A: One will be made public soon, with examples of output.
