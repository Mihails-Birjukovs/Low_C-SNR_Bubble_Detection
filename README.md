# Low_C-SNR_Bubble_Detection
A Wolfram Mathematica image processing code for bubble flow images with low SNR/CNR.  
Originally developed for high-FPS neutron imaging through thick (~ 30 mm) liquid metal layers.  

ATTENTION: the post-processing part of the code uses a package

The image processing code is in the MAIN notebook; the two other notebooks are the code used for validation based on reference experiments.

Q: How does the code work? Is it somehow validated?  
A: A preprint is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04883 where the inner workings are outlined.  
Performance & validation are also demonstrated. The paper is currently under review.


Q: How does one use the code?  
A: Instructions soon to be posted here.  


Q: Is there an example dataset to test the code?  
A: One will be made public soon, with examples of output.
